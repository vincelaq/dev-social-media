## Introduction: 
Connection. As developers, connection is the most important aspect of our careers. It is with connection that we have accomplished many great things and shaped the entire world. And if you don't believe it, all you have to do is look at what has been accomplished since the first higher-level programming language, Fortran, founded in 1957.

In a short time, we as developers have made such incredible strides. And the credit of those achievements are due to connection, to communication with each other and to the sharing of ideas with each other.

Today, one of the greatest tools of connection, is the internet. We have been able to gather on platforms such as StackOverflow, Developer Forums, GitHub, Mozilla, and Reddit. All of which have been great and have played a valuable role in Software Development. But now a new social media site rises to the pinnacle of resources, one which a Software Developer will use to find what they need and not need to look any further. May we present to you DevBook.

## What is DevBook?
DevBook is a new social media platform where Software Developers can share their code, ask for help, share ideas, discuss events and make valuable connections. The goal of DevBook is to provide a platform which will aid the advancement of the world.

## Why DevBook?
Most resources that Software Developers use to find answers, can be out of date. Google a simple variable and it will tell you to use "var" instead of "let" or "const". DevBook is focus on keeping up with industry standards. It will be a place where you can find the answers to you development issues in a modern way.

## The Design of DevBook
When coming up with the idea of DevBook, we wanted to make a platform that had up to date answers for not only students of Software Development but Senior Developers as well. We wanted a place where all types of developers can share and help one another. 
To make us different, we first looked at our competitors. Most used out of date syntax or had a timestamp that made you uncomfortable about the answers you found. In the technology world, updates occur on a regular basis and can make code obsolete. 
To further our study we asked Software Developers and Student Software Developers a number of questions. Some of the most important questions were, "Do you find the answer you were looking for on the first try? Do you trust those answers? Are they up to date with industry standards? Do you use multiple sources to locate you answers? If you can find multiple answers to a single question and be assured it up to industry standards, would you look for a different source?" A high percentage of responses stated that if a website was able to provide an industry standard answer consistently, that was current, they would use that resource before any others. 
It is with this research we came up with a simple yet effective Social Media Platform to be that one website that all Developers are looking for. Lets show you around...

## A Guided Walk-through of DevBook
We start here on the Login Page. At DevBook you would create a profile where you would be able to post content, share images, follow your favorite developers and comment on the post of you fellow Developers. But we first need to create a profile.
